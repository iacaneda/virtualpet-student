/*BONUS: Like any fun virtual pet game, your pet should be able to prove itself in
an arena (in a less-violent Pokemon way)! The arena already displays your pet on the
left side, a BATTLE! button, and another pet on the right. The right-side pet is your
pet's opponent.
You need to program the BATTLE! button's onclick function to:
1. Determine a winner of the current battle and display it
You need to program the New Battle button's onclick function to:
2. Change your pet's opponent image to start a new battle
You are given:
var ap = your pet's attack power
var apOpponent = your opponent's randomly generated attack power
var opponents = array of different image sources for the opponent's image
